Overview
This RTD dashboard is a real-time monitoring and visualization tool for Denver's RTD public transit data. It consumes the RTD GTFS-Realtime API to display vehicle locations and operational delays on a live web map.

The backend uses an event-driven architecture to process high-volume, real-time transit data and display it to the (eventual) front end dashboard.

Work in progress!
